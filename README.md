# DESCRIPTION

This is a Quiz Web application on which a quiz can be made to interact through a number of 10 enjoyable and engaging questions through which one gets to test himself. It aims to make a simple app easily navigable along with making an attractive appeal as it's quite basic and carries a neat view with a responsible look as of Bootstrap 4.5 with which it functions well both desktop and mobile applications.

The app provides each question with four possible answers, and the user selects the one they think is correct. Immediately after answering a question, the app shows whether the answer was correct or wrong and updates the score. A "Next" button allows users to move to the next question, with feedback appearing after each selection. As users continue answering, their score is displayed, and they get a sense of how well they're doing.

When the quiz has been finished, the user is presented with their final score and given the option to restart or close the quiz. The clean lines and intuitive interfaces make it easy to navigate, and the app runs quickly, uncluttered by unnecessary distractions.
 
 This is one of those web apps that any user can learn from, have fun with, and test themselves on while being given instant feedback.
